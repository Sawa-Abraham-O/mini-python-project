# Mini Python Projects by Abraham

Welcome to my Mini Python Projects repository! ðŸš€ This repo showcases my journey as an aspiring software engineer through small Python projects. Each project demonstrates a new concept Iâ€™ve learned or practiced, from basic calculations to solving equations and generating passwords.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Abraham, an aspiring software engineer. Iâ€™m passionate about learning and building projects to sharpen my programming skills. This repository reflects my progress in Python and serves as a foundation for more advanced projects in the future.

## Projects

#### -- File_organiser.py

Description: A script designed to organize files in a directory by grouping them into folders based on their file types.

Concepts Used: File handling, os module, and directory management.


#### -- first_letter.py

Description: This script returns the first letter of any word entered by the user.

Concepts Used: String manipulation and user input.


#### -- math_project.py

Description: An interactive program that solves both simultaneous and quadratic equations. It uses loops to prompt the user for the type of operation they wish to perform.

Concepts Used: Loops, conditionals, user input, and math operations.


#### -- password_generator.py

Description: Generates random and secure passwords of a specified length to enhance online security.

Concepts Used: Random module, loops, and string manipulation.


#### -- product_numbers.py

Description: This script returns the product of any two numbers input by the user.

Concepts Used: Basic arithmetic operations and user input.


#### -- quadsolve.py

Description: Solves quadratic equations using the formula method. Simply input the coefficients, and the program will calculate the roots.

Concepts Used: Math operations and the quadratic formula.


#### -- simple_interest.py and simple_interest_calculator.py

Description: Both scripts calculate the simple interest based on the formula:


Simple Interest = Principal Ã— Rate Ã— Time

#### -- translate.py

Description: A script that converts text to its "leet" equivalent by replacing certain characters with numbers or symbols.

Concepts Used: String manipulation and the .replace() method.


## Why This Repo?

This repository is my way of documenting my progress and sharing what Iâ€™ve learned so far. Each project, no matter how small, has contributed to improving my problem-solving skills in Python. I aim to keep adding more projects as I advance further into more complex topics.

### How to Run
```bash
1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Sawa-Abraham-O/mini-python-project.git
```

2. Navigate to the desired project folder and run the Python file:
```bash
cd mini-python-project
python <file_name>.py
```


# What's Next?

Iâ€™m constantly learning, and I plan to expand this repository with more complex projects as I explore advanced Python topics like APIs, data structures, and algorithms. Stay tuned for more updates!
